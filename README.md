# odin-Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch from the Odin Project
Cool project!
### Issues
One bug I noticed was something if you click div and drag, something it toggles mouseDown to be false and when you let go it will continue to paint. 
I will figure this one out when I get more knowledge under my belt!
